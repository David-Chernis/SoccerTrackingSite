# SoccerTrackingSite
A site that lets you look at stats of football teams in the 2015-2016 premier league as well as player stats, etc. 

We used an aws mysql database to store the data of team and player stats throughout the 2015-2016 season of the premier league.

the rest of the project was implemented using javascript with react for the frontend and the data was gathered using the sportmonks api.
